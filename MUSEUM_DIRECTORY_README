# Welcome To The Flatiron Museum Of Art
### A Command Line Interface Application by Ana Harris, and Andrew Rivera

## short description
We have created a CLI application that allows Museum visitors to obtain information about the Artists, pieces of artwork and galleries located in The Flatiron Museum of Art (not a real place, maybe in the future... who knows?)

## install instructions

1.) Fork the file and clone it to your computer

2.) Run 'bundle install' to downloand all the necessary gems

3.) Run 'rake db:seed' in order to populate the seed data for the museum

4.) Run  'ruby bin/run.rb' to initiate the CLI application
